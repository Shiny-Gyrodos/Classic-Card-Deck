This is a simulation of a classical card deck.

It is it's own class and file, so it can be easily copy/pasted into any project where cards are needed.
Cards created are objects of the Card class.

Some features of this code are:
1. CreateDeck, EraseDeck, and Draw cards functions.
2. Customizable hand limit, draw amount, hand remove amount.
3. You can acces the card's value (2, 5, 11, etc.), suite (hearts, diamonds, etc.), and name (five, ace, queen, etc.).

Q. Is this code written as efficiently as possible? A. No, but it does function for it's intended purpose, while remaining easily readable.
Q. How much room is there for easy customization? A. Quite a lot, you can't simulate non-classical decks with it though.
Q. Does the deck include joker cards? A. No, jokers are dumb.

Thanks for checking out my dumb stuff.
